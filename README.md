3. First you need to open the roast wander "Background Page" from the `chrome://extensions/` page. Otherwise, we can't maintain state between jitsi pages to keep going if there's nobody in the room. (I think)

4. You then need to go to your first jitsi room, and hit the button in the browser. If there are multiple people in the room, you have to hit the "R" button a few times.
